# Lessons learned
- Like it says in the homework right at the top. Start with what you know. And write it in English. I took that very literally, I had almost 100 lines of comments before I started the project.


- It could be inferred that I should spam do/while loops a bit less. Why I find them to be the only way I do not know. I definitely tried to nest them 3 deep but I ended up doing something slightly less painful. 



- I do think that I would need a triple nested for loop to make the game play with more decks though. I can't think of a different way.



- I forced myself to use a switch for the first time in a homework so far. It's literally the same as an if/else-if so that makes it seem much simpler to me.


- I definitely didn't solve the homework perfectly. I could see how I could improve it in some ways by the time I finished with it.
 
 
- I would say that my understanding of methods, loops, encapsulation.
