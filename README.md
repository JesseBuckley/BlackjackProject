# BlackjackProject

# Description
- The Blackjack Project is one that simulates Blackjack the comparing card game.


- You will go through prompts to try and best the dealer in a game of 21.

# How To Run
- Run BlackjackApplication; you will be prompted to enter Y(es) or N(o) (not case sensitive) to sit down and play a round of Blackjack against the dealer. 


- If you select Y(es), the dealer will deal you, the player, two cards as well as themselves.


- Depending on the way the cards end up dealt. You could find yourself seeing any sort of these outcomes that correlate to Blackjack's rules:
- Hit
- Stand
- Bust 
- Blackjack


- The dealer shares similar functions however, the logic is automated based on the rules of Blackjack.


- One you win, lose, or push. You will be given the option to play again.

# Lessons learned
- Like it says in the homework right at the top. Start with what you know. And write it in English. I took that very literally, I had almost 100 lines of comments before I started the project.


- It could be inferred that I should spam do/while loops a bit less. Why I find them to be the only way I do not know. I definitely tried to nest them 3 deep but I ended up doing something slightly less painful. 


- I forced myself to use a switch for the first time in a homework so far. It's literally the same as an if/else-if so that makes it seem much simpler to me.


- I definitely didn't solve the homework perfectly. I could see how I could improve it in some ways by the time I finished with it.
 
 
- I would say that my understanding of methods, loops, encapsulation.


# Still To Do
- Add prompt to split when cards are the same rank. Which would give the user two hands to play essentially.



- Add function to ace with logic to be 1 or 11. And implement dealers Ace related rules.



- Figure out was how to exit my switch within a Do/While. Because I use a break; to exit my statements. But the switch is within a Do/While loop so it would just break when the player selects no. System.exit() seems like a cheap working solution for now. But I am almost certain there's another way.
